# Project Name

Class feedback 

## Description

Our client wanted a site where users could give feedback on their class experience each day. They wanted a nummerical ranking system (1-5, 1 being poor and 5 being great) for fields including content understangin, support, and feeling. They also requested a place for comments so users could give additional feedback or suggestions. After each field, all of which were required except comments, was complete they gave a chance to review feedback before submitting. Once the user clicked submit the site returns to the initial page.

To create an API such as this one you would need:
React
Redux
Node_Modules
