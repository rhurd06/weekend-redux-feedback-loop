# Prime Class feedback

## Description

Duration: 12 hours

Our client wanted a site where users could give feedback on their class experience each day. They wanted a nummerical ranking system (1-5, 1 being poor and 5 being great) for fields including content understanding, support, and feeling.
Here's a view of what one of those pages could look like:
![Feedback feeling](./wireframes/Feedback-feeling-wireframe.png)

They also requested a place for comments so users could give additional feedback or suggestions.
Here's what the comments page might look like:
![Feedback](./wireframes/Commentspage.png)

All fields were required except the comments page. After the survey was complete the client wanted the user to have a chance to review feedback before submitting.
Here's a look at the review page:

Once the user clicked submit they receive a 'Thank You' and have the option to leave new feedback by clicking on that button.

To create an API such as this one you would need:
React
Redux
Node_Modules
